This shows how to make a test suite building its own PTEF binaries, independent
of anything provided by the OS.

This allows the suite to build and run unprivileged, though it does require some
package dependencies to be provided by the OS, more than would be required for
installing PTEF as a binary package.

Do 'make' prior to running.

To run tests from inside the hierarchy manually (rather than running the full
suite), source the 'run' in top level first (from a bash shell).
This will export some env variables into your current shell.
