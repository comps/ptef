Some test suite use an intermediary layer between tests and the execution logic
to re-use test code by parametrizing the tests.

For example, a test can check ELF binary properties of any passed argument,
reporting PASS/FAIL for that file. An intermediary "runconf" then specifies
several executions of that same test, with different arguments.

These "runconf" files can be a simple static language (like runtest files in the
Linux Test Project), or they can be scripts that dynamically select/parametrize
the tests based on environment.

This example uses bash "runconf", defining a custom function called '+' that
appends user-provided strings into a big array, which simply get passed to
ptef-runner during a default argument-less run.
When arguments are given on CLI, anything from runconf is ignored and the CLI
arguments are used instead, preserving standard PTEF behavior.
