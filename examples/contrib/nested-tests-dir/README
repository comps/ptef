Some projects contain things other than tests and like to therefore have
the tests confined in some subdirectory, typically 'tests' or 'test'.
At the same time, they might want to run these from outside that directory,
perhaps adding their own setup, waiving logic, etc. in a wrapper.

The code below demonstrates how one can achieve that fairly transparently.

Try (from outside 'tests'):
    ./run
    ./run test1
    ./run /test1
    ./run tests/test1    # bash tab completion
