This shows how to make a test suite building its own PTEF binaries, independent
of anything provided by the OS.

This is a CLI-only trivial version of the 'standalone' example - see that one
if you need full C / bash / python API support.

The advantage of this version is that it has very minimal build dependencies
- basically just a C compiler and GNU Make, that's it. If all you care about
is running ptef-* CLI commands from shell-based tests, that's all you need.

Do ie.

    dnf install gcc make curl

prior to issuing 'make' and './run'.

To run tests from inside the hierarchy manually (rather than running the full
suite), source the 'run' in top level first (from a bash shell).
This will export some env variables into your current shell.
