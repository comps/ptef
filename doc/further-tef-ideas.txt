- don't have tefresults as binary log
- instead, output verbose, debug info, (or errors) and store it in logs/, like with any executed test (which presumably uses stdout/stderr for verbose data)
- get rid of any binary formats, any "if stdout is the same terminal as fd 0", etc.

- basically:
- use logs/ for verbose optional debug whatever output
  - also allows easy manual debugging via a runner option that doesn't redirect stderr to a file, but leaves it attached to terminal
- if fd 0 is a terminal, output (the text version of) the test results to it (STATUS and test name, full path with TEF_PREFIX)
- if some variable (TEF_RESULTS or whatever) is set to a fd number, output the stuff sent to fd 0 tty to this fd as well



TODO:
- specify execution order (alphanumerical)
- passed arguments need to be normalized, paths leading up ('..') rejected/trimmed
