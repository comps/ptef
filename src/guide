- examples/ dir - requires ptef installed on the system
  - simple symlinks example
    - simple 'run' symlinks + trivial standalone tests
    - shared test lib in utils/ sourced by bash tests
      - ie. function for checking service status
  - custom mini wrapper in utils/ symlinked in other dirs that would
    run all tests via 'time', measuring their time, logging it to some
    single file along with test name; see also bash TIMEFORMAT
  - more complex example with one executable checking multiple services
    and reporting each via ptef_report
  - add an example under examples/ showing off how to 'find .' a custom list
    of executables and pass it via xargs to ptef-runner
    - use 'xargs -a $tmpfile' to preserve stdin
    - sort it alphabetically, but in reverse, to show the posibilities,
      also include hidden executables, also skip some exec name
  - post-processing results via PTEF_RESULTS_FD pipe + waiving tool
    - custom color map in the waiving tool
  - subshell spawned as background job using ptef_report MARK $(date)
